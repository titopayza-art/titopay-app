// WHICH BUILD IS ACTUALLY RUNNING ON THE SERVER?
//
// Four separate debugging sessions have now started with a feature that was
// present in the code, proven by tests and a live harness, and absent on the
// customer's phone: the TitoKids co-parent screen, the "Not found" ticketing
// panel, the admin console's ticketing metrics reading R0.00, and the
// wristband Link button. In every case the answer was the same, and in every
// case it took an investigation to establish it, because the deployed API
// state was invisible from outside.
//
// The PWA solved this for itself: index.html carries app.min.js?v=NNN, so the
// running bundle can be read in one request. This is the same idea for the
// API. GET /health reports the build, so "is the server current?" becomes one
// curl instead of an afternoon.
//
// BUMP API_BUILD whenever api.zip is rebuilt for deployment, and add a line to
// the notes below. The number is deliberately a plain integer: it only has to
// answer "newer or older than the build that contains the fix".

const API_BUILD = 4;

// Most recent first. Keep this short; it is a deployment aid, not a changelog.
